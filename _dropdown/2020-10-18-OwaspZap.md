>First of all I'd like to thank all members of the community who have contributed with this amazing project!

If you don't know what is this project, you can check the [official github](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy).<br>

This post will be focused to explain the modifications that I've done.



## Motivation

I was using the `zapproxy` to test APIs, but in certain moments I felt difficulty to scan the APIs which needed of authentication.<br>
I had 3 environments ['Development','Homolog','Production']. Then over a hundred APIs to test, most of them authenticated. So I decided to create some files and adapt my needs in a generic way, so that it could be used by other people.


## zap_ConfigFile

This is the main file, which control all the things.<br> 
In this file I do some actions in this order: 

* Set the environment variables
* Read all swaggers from the directory
* Call the authentication function
* Create the config file
* Start the container


### zap_Auth

<br>

I've created an example content, using the [Juice Shop](https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com) as my target. This file is simple you just have to put code to authenticate into your target and then return the "Final_token".<br>

### .prop file

<br>

Now it's time to create the `swagger_Name.prop` file, which will serve us as the config file containing all the Headers we want to. Including the token from the authentication, or even another value, you are free to add any new header and set up to your request.

### zap_environment

<br>

The environment is set, to identify which one you have chosen. And finally the container is called passing all the necessary arguments. But to get it working I had to modify the zap-api-scan.py and zap-common files.


## Zap_api_scan

<img src="/assets/img/Zap_API_File.png">
<br>

This is the core of the zapproxy API scan, so I did carefully changes.

* Added new option for the environment `"-e"`.
* Changed the "hardcoded path", to the new one coming from the environment file.
* Then passed the new base_dir variable to the add_zap_options function.

This function is called by:

### zap-common

<img src="/assets/img/Zap_Common_File.png">
<br>

Basically this files is called by function add_zap_options, now can it read the .prop config file based on the environment and set it up to the scan. Instead of passing all the arguments inline.


## Conclusion

Now you can have multiple environments with a lot of APIs with different authentications and you will be able to scan in a more assertive way.<br>
